ROS2-based packages for controlling an Andino differential drive robot for performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. This is for my 2024-2025 Semester 2 High School Senior Project. The packages involved include one custom-developed package for teleoperation control and one that sets up and runs the LD19/LD20 LiDAR Sensor.
